## Projects
### Predicting Non-Performing Loans for a Development Finance Institution Using Ensemble Model 
[Code](https://github.com/TosinSDGs/TosinSDGs/blob/main/NPL_Modeling.ipynb)

Developed and implemented a supervised machine learning model to determine non-performing loans for debt clients using various classifiers, including Histgradient Boost, LigthGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, and an ensemble model combining all four.

### Developing and evaluating a predictive model that predicts whether a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit
[Code](https://github.com/TosinSDGs/TosinSDGs/blob/main/Banking_Project.ipynb)

The project aims to explore the effectiveness of different classifiers, such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and AdaBoost, both individually and as an ensemble. The evaluation metrics used, including balanced accuracy, PR AUC, F1 score, and log-loss function, provide insights into the model's performance in terms of precision, recall, and overall predictive accuracy.


### Cancer Diagnosis Classification Project
[Code](https://github.com/TosinSDGs/TosinSDGs/blob/main/Cancer_Diagnosis_Project.ipynb)

Developed a robust cancer classification model leveraging logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest algorithms to accurately differentiate between malignant and benign tumors. This model aims to provide healthcare professionals with a reliable tool for early cancer detection and treatment recommendation, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates.

### Resume Screening and Classification for HR
[Code](https://github.com/TosinSDGs/TosinSDGs/blob/main/Resume_Classification_Project.ipynb)

Developed an NLP-based resume screening and classification system for our HR department, incorporating sentiment analysis, TF-IDF feature extraction, and a Random Forest classifier. This project aims to streamline our hiring process, enabling us to automatically categorize and assess job applicants' resumes efficiently. By harnessing natural language understanding and machine learning, we intend to identify the most suitable candidates while ensuring a positive candidate experience.

### Web Scraping and Analysis of Online Reviews
[Code](https://github.com/TosinSDGs/TosinSDGs/blob/main/Analysis_of_Online_Review.ipynb)

Created an NLP-driven analysis system for online product reviews, incorporating sentiment analysis, word cloud visualization, and TF-IDF techniques. This project aims to gain actionable insights from customer feedback, helping us better understand product satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and enhance the overall shopping experience. By leveraging natural language processing and data-driven approaches, we intend to make data-informed decisions that boost customer satisfaction and drive business growth.
